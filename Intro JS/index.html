      <h1>To the Girl Who Never Gave Up</h1>
      <p>
        Hey Beautiful, You did it. You held yourself through the storms. You
        believed in your own voice. You showed up. And look at you now, still
        curious, still creative, still choosing joy. Never stop.
        <br /><br />
        Youâ€™ve grown into such a curious, bold soul. You became
        hyper-independent not by choice, but by strength, and that strength
        taught you to trust your voice.
        <br />
        You've made decisions on your own, stumbled sometimes, soared other
        times, and kept moving with wisdom in your pocket. Every mistake became
        a lesson. Every lesson became a new layer of you. And somehow, youâ€™ve
        made risk feel like art.
        <br /><br />
        Stay wild. Stay grounded. Keep choosing yourself. With pride.
      </p>
